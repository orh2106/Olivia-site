      <h3>Quantum Primitive for Output-Hiding Function Computation</h3>
      <button class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button>
      <div class="abstract">
        <p>A quantum information–theoretic primitive is presented for computing a discrete-valued function that depends on multiple parties’ local private inputs. The resulting function values are shared among the parties, but may remain hidden from any external observer, as well as from any adversarial state-preparation or measurement process within the quantum system, in every iteration. The primitive underlies a broad class of secure communication and computation protocols, including quantum key distribution, function evaluation, multi-party coordination and decision schemes, and private signatures, among others.</p>

      <h3>Quantum-Enabled Decentralized Mechanisms</h3>
      <button class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button>
      <div class="abstract">
        <p>
        Quantum information resources enable decentralized sharing and coordination on local private information between interacting agents without classical communication. In non-local measurement settings, this framework permits full information revelation between agents, a capability impossible in classical environments.
This paper shows by example, that information revealed to agents conditional on joint measurement outcomes can facilitate decentralized classical mechanisms, which may be used to conduct joint decisions, such as marketplace transactions, without any central authority or cryptographic commitments. The mechanism additionally may be designed so as to obscure information obtained from within the quantum system itself.

      <h3>Quantum Games of Incomplete Information</h3>
      <button class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button>
      <div class="abstract">
        <p>
        This paper studies games of incomplete information in which players’ interactions are mediated by quantum information resources. I establish classical baseline conditions, closely related to Bell non-locality, that characterize outcome distributions implementable under classical correlation, and show by example that quantum implementations can violate these conditions, yielding equilibrium outcomes unattainable classically.

Quantum advantage arises not from restricting feasible outcomes, but from allowing greater flexibility in how outcome distributions vary across states of Nature. In particular, quantum interactions enable decentralized sharing and coordination on local private information without classical communication. In non-local measurement settings, this framework permits full information revelation between players, a capability impossible in classical environments.

These results highlight a new informational role for quantum resources in strategic interaction, with implications for decentralized coordination, distributed computation, and classical mechanism design.

      <h3>Quantum Games of Complete Information</h3>
      <button class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button>
      <div class="abstract">
        <p>
        Previous work in quantum game theory has shown that in environments where players can utilize quantum information resources, they can achieve higher expected payoffs in a Nash equilibrium than in any classical counterpart. This paper studies a class of complete information quantum games, where the chosen basis and initial state may be considered as design choices which determine the set of feasible outcome distributions in a Nash equilibrium in quantum strategies. I derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a Nash equilibrium in quantum strategies to Pareto improve upon classical correlated equilibria in quantum games in local measurement bases with maximally-entangled initial states.

      <h3>Platform Preferencing and Price Competition I: Evidence from Amazon</h3>
      <p class="coauthors">with Andreas Haupt</p>
      <button class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button>
      <div class="abstract">
        <p>
        A platform's preferencing mechanism, or rule that assigns the 
placement of offers on a platform,
        determines both firm and consumer welfare. First, we theoretically 
derive a platform's
        consumer-optimal preferencing rule in a setting in which firms 
choose prices in a locally envy-free
        profile, given the preferencing rule. In special cases, locally 
envy-free outcomes correspond with
        equilibria in a Generalized Second Price auction. Additionally, we 
show that Reimers and Waldfogel
        (2023)'s empirical test to measure platform bias is valid even 
under prices that are endogenous to the
        preferencing rule in a locally envy-free profile. On Amazon, we 
measure the extent of platform bias
        using a large dataset from the platform during the years 
2020–2022.

      <h3>Platform Preferencing and Price Competition II: Evidence from Amazon</h3>
      <button class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button>
      <div class="abstract">
        <p>
        A previous study of platform preferencing is extended to an 
environment in which firm prices are
        determined in a non-myopic, dynamic setting, which depends on the 
platform's preferencing rule.
        These dynamic pricing strategies result in pricing patterns that 
closely resemble Edgeworth cycles.
        I provide a method to estimate the primitives that govern these 
pricing cycles, which allows me to
        assess the counterfactual welfare implications associated with 
various preferencing rules, using a
        large dataset from the Amazon platform from 2018–2022. The welfare 
effects of policy proposals in
        this environment, in particular those that eliminate 
self-preferencing, significantly differ from those
        under the static price competition environment.

      <h3>Interdependent-Value Auctions and Competition</h3>
      <button class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</button>
      <div class="abstract">
        <p>
        Most of auction theory is concerned with studying mechanisms that 
maximize efficiency in settings
        in which bidder valuations are independent. However, in many 
real-world settings, firms engage in
        strategic behavior ex-post auction, in which their payoffs depend 
not only on their auction
        allocations, but also their rivals’. Moreover, auction rules that 
aim to maximize efficiency may come
        at the cost of consumer welfare, when auctions enable certain 
bidders excessive shares in
        downstream markets.
        </p>
        <p>
        This paper aims to study the question of how an auctioneer can 
shape market power and downstream
        competition via design choices in an auction when bidder 
valuations are interdependent.
        First, we study bidder behavior in simultaneous ascending auctions 
in which bidder valuations arise
        from a downstream pricing game conditional on auction allocations. 
We then estimate the bidding
        restrictions that maximize consumer welfare in the mobile phone 
market, using data from
        simultaneous ascending auctions conducted by the FCC.
